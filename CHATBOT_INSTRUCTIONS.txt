Brief overview of the hackathon

A2SV will host the first of its type hackathon focused on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for all African students to take part in. In this event participants will work together to develop a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool or find a new application of existing models in unexplored domains. Participants have a short window of time, usually a few days, to develop their concepts and present them to a jury.


The hackathon invites innovative students, enthusiasts, young technologists, data scientists and developers to solve real-world data challenges using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Participants will leverage AI to develop creative solutions to maximize human potential.

Hackathons can help participants hone their coding skills and keep up with current technology trends, meet people and work with others in their field. This is the first of its kind beginner-friendly hackathon designed for students of all experience levels and backgrounds to take part in, as long as they are Africans. Through A2SV Hackathon, we aim to support students with skilled mentors, build helpful products, and enable you to create an impactful solution that you can develop long-term.

Name of the hackathon:
Generative AI Hackathon 


Why the theme of Generative AI?

Generative AI offers a unique opportunity to tap into the rich tapestry of African cultures, traditions, and knowledge, allowing us to create innovative solutions that resonate with our unique challenges and aspirations as Africans. This domain enables us to unleash the creative potential of African students, providing a platform for them to contribute their fresh perspectives and insights to the global tech landscape. By embracing generative AI, we empower Africans to be pioneers, breaking free from the shackles of limited access to resources and representation in the playing field. 

For the first time in decades, Africa can catch up in the emerging field of generative AI technology. Getting an equal start in the domain allows us to craft solutions that are authentically African, addressing the pressing issues faced by our communities and propelling us forward towards sustainable development. The Generative AI Hackathon isn't just about competing; it's about redefining the narrative of African excellence, reclaiming our space in the global technology ecosystem, and forging a brighter future for generations to come. Together, let us seize this moment and showcase the immense talent and potential that lies within our continent.

Judgment Process
Criteria for judging projects
Innovation and Creativity: Judges will look for projects that showcase unique and creative solutions to the problem statement or challenge. They will evaluate the originality of the idea and how well it addresses the problem.

Technical Implementation: Judges will evaluate the technical skills demonstrated by the team, including the complexity of the project, how well it was built, and the level of technical challenges that were overcome.

User Experience & Completeness: Judges will evaluate how well the solution meets the needs of its intended users. They will look at factors such as usability, accessibility, and user feedback and how complete the project is.

Impact: Judges will evaluate how well the project addresses the specific challenges faced by African university students. They will look at factors such as the problem's relevance, how well it was defined, and the potential impact of the solution on the targeted group.

Presentation: Judges will evaluate how well the project is presented and communicated to the judges and other participants. This includes the quality of the pitch, the clarity of the presentation, and the ability of the team to convey the value and potential of their solution.


Explanation of the judging panel and their expertise
Scoring system and evaluation methodology

Our project evaluation methodology is designed around four key areas. The first is Innovation and Creativity, which assesses the uniqueness, originality, and creativity of the projects. The second area of focus is Impact, considering the relevance of the project, its feasibility, and potential impact. User Experience and Technical Excellence form the third pillar of our assessment, evaluating a project's implementation, scalability, and functionality. The last area is the Presentation and Pitch, where we assess the clarity and engagement of the presentation, the persuasiveness of the pitch, and the professionalism of the participants.


Transparency and fairness measures in the judging process
Regarding the Transparency and fairness measures in the judging process, we have implemented several measures to ensure transparency and fairness in our judging process. The evaluation criteria are clear and well-defined, ensuring that all projects are assessed against the same standards. The evaluation process is blind, meaning judges are unaware of the participant's identities, eliminating any potential bias. The order of presentations is randomized, ensuring that no project has an advantage or disadvantage due to its position in the lineup.
We have also assembled a diverse panel of judges with various backgrounds and expertise to provide well-rounded evaluations. A standardized scoring system is used to maintain consistency across evaluations, and a confidentiality agreement prevents judges from prematurely disclosing information about the projects or their evaluations.
Participants can expect open feedback from the judges after the presentations, promoting transparency and providing insights for future improvement. Lastly, we have a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism to address any concerns about the judging process, thus ensuring that any potential discrepancies or questions are resolved fairly and transparently.
